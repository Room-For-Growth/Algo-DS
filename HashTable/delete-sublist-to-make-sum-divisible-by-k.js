```
You are given a list of positive integers nums and a positive integer k. Return the length of the shortest sublist (can be empty sublist ) you can delete such that the resulting list's sum is divisible by k. You cannot delete the entire list. If it's not possible, return -1.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 8, 6, 4, 5]
k = 7
Output
2
Explanation
We can remove the sublist [6, 4] to get [1, 8, 5] which sums to 14 and is divisible by 7.
